ALX Simple Shell Project

A Shell That:

_Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.
_The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.
_The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features.
_The command lines are made only of one word. No arguments will be passed to programs.
_If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.
_Handle errors.
_You have to handle the “end of file” condition (Ctrl+D)
